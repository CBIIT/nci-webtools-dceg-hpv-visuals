Human Papillomavirus Automated Visual Evaluation (HPV AVE) Website

The HPV AVE website provides visual examples of the natural history/carcinogenic process of HPV infection and progression to precancer, accompanied by relevant clinical data. This platform addresses a significant gap in clinical comprehension of the carcinogenic process and provides exposure to images that are true representations of meaningful changes in the appearance of the cervix that require clinical action.
