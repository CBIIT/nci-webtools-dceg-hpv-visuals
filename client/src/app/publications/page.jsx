                  This study describes the study protocol for PAVE, which
                  includes screening with HPV self-collection using HPV
                  genotyping and image and cervical biopsy collection to train
                  automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithms. During PAVE
                  study, women who screen HPV-positive are managed with VIA,
                  colposcopy, and/or ablative or excisional treatment per
                  in-country standard-of-care. The goal of the PAVE study is to
                  develop an accurate, low-cost, screen-triage protocol. The
                  PAVE strategy uses self-collected HPV testing for screening
                  followed by triage of HPV-positives using genotyping
                  information from the screening test and point-of-care AVE
                  information at the time of cervical examination. The PAVE
                  strategy allows risk-based management using country-specific
                  protocols and focuses treatment resources on those most likely
                  to develop cancer.

                  algorithms will function when deployed outside of test
                  settings. Key elements for ensuring portability of an AI
                  algorithm to a new dataset include clarifying the target
                  population, aligning AVE categories with HPV natural history,
                  training on representative images from the four stages of
                  cervical carcinogenesis, carefully selecting the AI algorithm,
                  and performing internal validation to test accuracy and
                  external validation to avoid overfitting. Performing external
                  validation and field testing is critical to ensure that AI
                  functions well outside of the test setting. Introducing deep
                  learning-based methods prematurely threatens their eventual

                  This study describes successful application of the AVE
                  algorithm developed for the PAVE study in a new dataset.
                  Following training and internal validation studies, the
                  algorithm was retrained using 40 images each from three image
                  categories that correspond to HPV natural history: normal,
                  indeterminate, precancer/cancer. Precancer risk was then
                  estimated using the output of the retrained algorithm in
                  combination with HPV genotyping results using the four
                  hierarchical categories described above (HPV16 &gt; 18/45 &gt;
                  31/33/35/52/58 &gt; 39/51/56/59/68). This produces a 12-level
                  risk scale, from low risk (HPV 39/51/56/59/68 and normal AVE
                  classification) to high risk (HPV16 precancer/cancer
                  classification). The predictive value of the risk estimates
                  was confirmed using histologic biopsy data. HPV type, AVE
                  classification, and the 12-level risk scale all were strongly
                  associated with biopsy diagnoses. Women living with HIV had
                  higher prevalence of precancer/cancer; the HPV-AVE risk
                  categories strongly predicted diagnostic findings in these
                  women as well.

                  This study addresses the current issues in AI including:
                  overfitting, lack of portability, and unrealistic,
                  near-perfect performance estimates by developing and
                  evaluating several models on their relative portability,
                  repeatability, and classification performance using a large,
                  collated, multi-institutional dataset of 9,462 women (17,013
                  images). The top performing model, when combined with HPV
                  type, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating
                  Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 within our study
                  population of interest, and a limited total extreme
                  misclassification rate of 3.4% on held-aside test sets.

                  If model repeatability is not assessed in AI development,
                  models will be unusable in clinical practice. This study
                  describes using Monte Carlo dropout predictions to improve AI
                  model repeatability. Using 20 Monte Carlo iterations
                  significantly increases repeatability, in particular at the
                  class boundaries, for all tasks on the binary, multi-class,
                  and ordinal models leading to an average reduction of the 95%
                  limits of agreement by 16% points and of the class
                  disagreement rate by 7% points. Both classification accuracy
                  and repeatability are improved in most settings.

                  If images are not of adequate quality, an AI algorithm may not
                  function or may provide inaccurate outputs. This study
                  classified images into four quality categories
                  (&quot;unusable&quot;, &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;,
                  &quot;limited&quot;, and &quot;evaluable&quot;) and improved
                  the quality classification performance by automatically
                  identifying mislabeled and overly ambiguous images. Testing on
                  a dataset of 87,420 images obtained from 14,183 patients from
                  diverse studies and geographic regions worldwide.
