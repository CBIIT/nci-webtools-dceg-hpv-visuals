                  cervical biopsy collection to train automated visual
                  evaluation (AVE) algorithms. During PAVE study, wWomen who

                  This paper describes successful application of the AVE
                  algorithm developed for the PAVE study in a new dataset.
                  Following training and internal validation studies, the
                  algorithm was retrained using 40 images each from three image
                  categories that correspond to HPV natural history: normal,
                  indeterminate, precancer/cancer. Precancer risk was then
                  estimated using the output of the retrained algorithm in
                  combination with HPV genotyping results using the four
                  hierarchical categories. This produces a 12-level risk scale,
                  from low risk and normal AVE classification to high risk
                  precancer/cancer classification. The predictive value of the
                  risk estimates was confirmed using histologic biopsy data. HPV
                  type, AVE classification, and the 12-level risk scale all were
                  strongly associated with biopsy diagnoses. Women living with
                  HIV had higher prevalence of precancer/cancer; the HPV-AVE
                  risk categories strongly predicted diagnostic findings in
                  these women as well.

                  Critical steps for ensuring that AI algorithms will function
                  when deployed outside of test settings. Key elements for
                  ensuring portability of an AI algorithm to a new dataset
                  include clarifying the target population; aligning AVE
                  categories with HPV natural history; training on
                  representative images from the four stages of cervical
                  carcinogenesis; carefully selecting the AI algorithm; and
                  performing internal validation to test accuracy and external
                  validation to avoid overfitting. External validation and field
                  testing ensures that AI functions well outside of the test
                  setting. Introducing deep learning-based methods prematurely
                  threatens their eventual acceptance and best use.

                  This paper addresses the current issues in AI including
                  overfitting, lack of portability, and unrealistic,
                  near-perfect performance estimates by developing and
                  evaluating several models on their relative portability,
                  repeatability, and classification performance using a large,
                  collated, multi-institutional dataset of 9,462 women (17,013
                  images). The top performing model, when combined with HPV
                  type, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating
                  Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 within our study
                  population of interest, and a limited total extreme
                  misclassification rate of 3.4% on held-aside test sets.

                  This paper describes using Monte Carlo dropout predictions to
                  improve AI model repeatability. If model repeatability is not
                  assessed in AI development, models will be unusable in
                  clinical practice. Using 20 Monte Carlo iterations
                  significantly increases repeatability, in particular at the
                  class boundaries, for all tasks on the binary, multi-class,
                  and ordinal models leading to an average reduction of the 95%
                  limits of agreement by 16% points and of the class
                  disagreement rate by 7% points. Both classification accuracy
                  and repeatability are improved in most settings.
